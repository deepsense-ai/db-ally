# SQL benchmarks

This folder contains benchmarks for querying SQL databases with db-ally. This suite evaluates the following components:

- `COLLECTION` - measures correctness of SQL queries generated by the collection in a multi-view setup.
- `IQL-VIEW` - measures correctness of SQL queries generated by structured views.
- `SQL-VIEW` - measures correctness of SQL queries generated by freeform views.

All benchmarks are run on a dev split of the [BIRD](https://bird-bench.github.io/) dataset. For now, only one configuration is available to run the suite against the `superhero` database. We plan to extend it to all databases in the set to cover all cases.

New PRs adding support for new databases from BIRD or SPIDER are welcome.

## Run benchmarks

### Usage

Run the whole suite on the `superhero` database:

```bash
python bench.py --multirun component=iql-view,sql-view,collection data=superhero
```

You can also run each evaluation separately or in subgroups:

```bash
python bench.py component=iql-view
python bench.py --multirun component=iql-view,sql-view
```

Compare IQL generation performance on multiple LLMs:

```bash
python bench.py --multirun component=iql-view llm=gpt,claude
```

### Log to Neptune

Before running the suite with Neptune, configure the following environment variables:

```bash
export NEPTUNE_API_TOKEN="API_TOKEN"
export NEPTUNE_PROJECT="WORKSPACE_NAME/PROJECT_NAME"
```

Export evaluation results to Neptune:

```bash
python bench.py component=iql-view neptune=True
```

## Run tests

```bash
python -m pytest
```

## Metrics

This suite computes following metrics:

- `exact_match` - ratio of predicated queries that are identical to the ground truth ones.
- `exact_match` - estimates the pass@k metric for code synthesis.

## Add new dataset

In order to run this suite against you own dataset, upload your dataset to [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co) and make sure the data is in the format expected by the evaluation pipeline.

Evaluation dataset required fields:

- `question` - natural langugage SQL prompt
- `sql` - SQL corresponding to the SQL prompt
- `iql` - IQL corresponding to the SQL prompt
- `difficulty` - SQL code difficulty label
- `db_id` - database identifier


Additionaly, you need to create approprite structure and freeform view for downstream components
